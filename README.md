# genqlient: a truly type-safe Go GraphQL client

This is a proof-of-concept of using code-generation to create a truly type-safe GraphQL client in Go.  It is certainly not ready for production use!

## Why another GraphQL client?

To understand the issue, consider the example from the documentation of [shurcooL/graphql](https://github.com/shurcooL/graphql/):
```go
// to send a query `{ me { name } }`:
var query struct {
	Me struct {
		Name graphql.String
	}
}
// error handling omitted for brevity
client.Query(context.Background(), &query, nil)
fmt.Println(query.Me.Name)
// Output: Luke Skywalker
```
While this code may seem type-safe, and at the Go level it is, there's nothing to check that the schema looks like you expect it to.  In fact, perhaps here we're querying the GitHub API, in which the field is called `viewer`, not `me`, so this query will fail.  More common than misusing the name of the field is mis-capitalizing it, since Go and GraphQL have somewhat different conventions there.  And even if you get it right, it adds up to a lot of handwritten boilerplate!  And that's the best case; other clients, such as [machinebox/graphql](https://github.com/machinebox/graphql), have even fewer guardrails to help you make the right query and use the result correctly.  This isn't a big deal in a small application, but for serious production-grade tools it's not ideal.

These problems should be entirely avoidable: GraphQL and Go are both typed languages; and GraphQL servers expose their schema in a standard, machine-readable format.  We should be able to simply write a query `{ viewer { name } }`, have that automatically validated against the schema and turned into a Go struct which we can use in our code.  In fact, there's already good prior art to do this sort of thing: [99designs/gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) is a popular server library that generates types, and Apollo has a [codegen tool](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/cli/#supported-commands) to generate similar client-types for several other languages.  (See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for more prior art.)

This is a GraphQL client that does the same sort of thing: you specify the query, and it generates type-safe helpers that make your query.

## Usage

### Example

To use genqlient, put your GraphQL schema (in [SDL format](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/three-ways-to-represent-your-graphql-schema-a41f4175100d/#0c31)) in a file `schema.graphql`, and put a query like the following in `queries.graphql`:

```graphql
# queries.graphql
query getViewer {
  viewer {
    name
  }
}
```

Then run genqlient (`go run github.com/Khan/genqlient`), and it will generate:

```go
// generated.go (auto-generated):
type getViewerResponse struct { ... }
func getViewer(ctx context.Context, client *graphql.Client) (*getViewerResponse, error) { ... }
```

Finally, write your code to call genqlient, like so:

```go
// your code (error handling omitted for brevity)
graphqlClient := graphql.NewClient("https://example.com/graphql", nil)
viewerResp, _ := getViewer(context.Background(), graphqlClient)
fmt.Println("you are", viewerResp.Viewer.MyName)

//go:generate go run github.com/Khan/genqlient
```

For a complete working example, see [`example/`](example).  For configuration options, see [`go doc github.com/Khan/genqlient/generate.Config`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Khan/genqlient/generate#Config).

### Documentation for generated code

For each GraphQL operation (query or mutation), genqlient generates a Go function with the exact same name, which accepts:
- a `context.Context` (unless configured otherwise)
- a `genqlient/graphql.Client` (you might have a global one, or init it inline)
- arguments corresponding to the query arguments

It returns a pointer to a struct representing the query-result, and an `error`.  The struct will always be initialized (never nil), even on error.  The error may be a `github.com/vektah/gqlparser/v2/gqlerror.List`, if it was a GraphQL-level error (in this case the returned struct may still contain useful data, if the API returns data even on error), or may be another error if, for example, the whole HTTP request failed (in which case the struct is unlikely to contain useful data).  If the GraphQL operation has a comment immediately above it, that comment text will be used as the GoDoc for the generated function.

TODO: document generated types further, especially when they become customizable.

## Development

If you'd like to contribute to genqlient, welcome!  The library is still in a somewhat rough state, so please contact us (via an issue or email) before sending a PR.  We'll be ready for the rest of the world soon!

### Tests

`go test ./...` tests code generation.  (This is run by GitHub Actions.)  Most of the tests are snapshot-based; see `generate/generate_test.go`.

`make example` rebuilds the example, and tests that everything wires up to a real API correctly.  This is not currently included in `go test`, since it requires a token.

TODO(benkraft): Figure out how to get GitHub Actions a token to run the example.

### Design

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for documentation of major design decisions in this library.

### Major TODOs

(+) denotes things we further need before recommending anyone else use this in prod

Generated code:
- add flag(s) to make a field use a pointer (for optionality or perf; see DESIGN)
- redo support for interfaces, unions, fragments (see DESIGN)
- (optional) collapsing -- should be able to have `mutation { myMutation { error { code } } }` just return `(code string, err error)`

Config options:
- proper config/arguments setup (e.g. with [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper))
- (+) improve client_getter to be more usable (and document it), or flag it out for now.
- get schema via GraphQL introspection (although honestly, it seems like SDL is becoming popular enough there may be no need)
- send hash rather than full query
- whether names should be exported
- default handling for optional fields (pointers, HasFoo, etc.)
- response/function-name format (e.g. force exported/unexported, change "Response" suffix, change how input objects work, etc.)
- generate mocks?

Other:
- (+) improved validation and error checking
- (+) documentation
- get a designer to fix my bad logo-thing
- custom scalar types (or custom mappings for standard scalars, if you want a special ID type say)
- allow mapping a GraphQL type to a particular Go type (if you want to use a named type for some string, say)
- (optionally?) include full query in generated godoc
